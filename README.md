Software Security
I am not a fan of GitHub.
I do not believe it should be a graded requirement.

Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did the company want you to address?

Artemis Financial is a financial services organization that prioritizes secure handling of sensitive client information. Their primary requirement was to strengthen the security of their existing software by identifying vulnerabilities and implementing enhancements that reduce risk. They requested an assessment of their application’s security posture to ensure that confidential financial data would remain protected against modern threats.

What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?

I performed a thorough vulnerability review and accurately identified risks that could compromise confidentiality, integrity, or availability. I approached the findings systematically and ensured each issue was validated and clearly documented. Secure coding is essential because weak practices can lead to data breaches, financial loss, and reputational damage. Strong software security directly enhances organizational stability, resilience, and customer trust.

Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?

Helpful? None. Challenging? Trying to get Java to work. Java is the worse programming language out there to handle security due to its own security flaws. 

How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?

I increased security by applying layered defenses such as validating inputs, strengthening configuration settings, and reviewing potential attack vectors. In the future I would do nothing as my goal as a hacker is to break things, not make them secure. Also, I am a programmer so security is not as much my thing as it coding it. I will let networker's and QA's handle the security.

How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

I ensured functionality by testing the application after each modification to confirm that the system behaved as expected. To verify security, I reran vulnerability scans, reviewed dependency changes, and performed manual checks to confirm that no new issues had been introduced during refactoring. This systematic approach prevented regressions and maintained stability.

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?

None. I do not play with Java. I build Linux Distributions, and run Python, C++, C#, and Ruby.

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?

Nothing as I will not apply for a career in software security or Java coding.
